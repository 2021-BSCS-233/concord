A Flutter project as my final year project.

## Getting Started

This project is a combination of a chatting app and a QnA site.

It tries to remove the limitation of communication a QnA site has and limitation of a formal 
and publicly available QnA section in a chatting app

The project uses Flutter framework for app UI/UX, Firebase Firestone for real time database 
and a Node.js server
