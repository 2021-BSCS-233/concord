# Enforce LF line endings for all text files
* text=auto eol=lf
# Or, if you want specific file types:
# *.dart text eol=lf
# *.json text eol=lf
# *.plist text eol=lf
# *.cc text eol=lf
# *.h text eol=lf
# *.cmake text eol=lf
# *.swift text eol=lf
# *.lock text eol=lf
# For generated files, consider if you want them treated as text or binary.
# Often generated files should also have consistent line endings.
